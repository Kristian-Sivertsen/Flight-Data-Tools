# Flight-Data-Tools
Useful tools for aviation safety and accident investigators when working with flight data

A Technical report is also available describing the details of all of the tools.

The repository contains a number of files that can be used to process and analyse flight data. The repository contains the following branches:

1. A Simple-Data-Extrapolation-Tool that process simple position data (lat, long, alt, time) to provide additional information such as roll, heading and speed. The additional information is useful for the other tools.

2. An Excel-to-KML macro file that generates a KML file directly from Excel position data rather than processing the data into CSV format before importing the data in Google Earth. It also ensures the visual settings always remain the same.

3. A number of Excel-to-XPlane files that enables replay of the flight data in X-Plane 12.
